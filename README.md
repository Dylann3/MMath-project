Code used for my MMath project on numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations.

CIR_simulations, IGBM_simulations and Deriv_free_milstein contain the code used for testing convergence rates of numerical methods for respective examples.

model_em, model_mil and model_rk contain neural network models used for the deep BSDE method.

singeCIR, multiCIR and Default_risk contain the code for implementing the deep BSDE method for the different examples.
